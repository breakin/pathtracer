educational path tracer
=======================
This is a path tracer written for educational purposes.
It will never be the best or the fastest.
It is written in stages with a blog post for each step.

There is shared code in shared/.
Then for each blog post there is a directory with a new version of the path tracer. Most code in those are  duplicated.
